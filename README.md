This task was performed by myself and my team over the span of 3 days.

**METHODOLOGY**

As a group, we decided to use the plotly python library as compared to matplotlib and geopandas because plotly is interractive and visually appealing while Matplotlib is better used for static data

**Scatter Map Visualization using plotly to show the world population across different countries**

**Basic Analysis**

The scatter map we have plotted tells us that China and India have the largest population sizes over the years. According to the scale, the countries with the largest populations have red markers while those with the lowest populations have purple markers

**Choropleth Visualisation of an Unemployment in the USA (2020)**

This dataset contains historical unemployment data for states in the United States from 1976 to 2022. It tracks key labor force statistics, including employment, unemployment, and population figures on a monthly basis. Additionally, it provides geographic information (latitude and longitude) to allow spatial analysis.
We have chosen to display this data using a choropleth visualisation.
Choropleth maps are maps that use differences in coloring or shading within pre defined areas to indicate the average values of a particular quantity in those areas.

**Data Used**

Unemployment in America Per US State - Unemployment in America Per US State.csv
